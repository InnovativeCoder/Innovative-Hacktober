# Elementify
You can convert almost any string you like into it's equivalent element symbol string.
<br>
At the time of writing there are `118` elements in the Periodic Table, hence to make the code work on all names I have added a few hypothetical symbols (which you can check [here](run.py)) untill they actually appear in the Periodic Table
<br>
## To Run:
To elementify your name open terminal and run the file<br>
```
python run.py
```
<br><br>
You can also pass the arguments in the terminal like<br>
``` 
python run.py --name Vibhor
```
>V I B Ho R

<br><br>
If you need to print Atomic Number too you can use -m or --more<br> 
```
python run.py --name 'Breaking bad' -m
```
>Br E A K In G Ba D 

>[35, 125, 124, 19, 49, 119, 56, 123]
