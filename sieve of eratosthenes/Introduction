Sieve of Eratosthenes

Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple and ancient algorithm used to find the prime numbers up to any given limit. It is one of the most efficient ways to find small prime numbers.

For a given upper limit n the algorithm works by iteratively marking the multiples of primes as composite, starting from 2. Once all multiples of 2 have been marked composite, the muliples of next prime, ie 3 are marked composite. This process continues until p≤ sqrt { n }

  where p is a prime number

Example:
Generate all the primes less than 11

First thing to note is that do not mark prime themselves as composite.

Create a list of integers from 2 to 10. list = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Start with p=2.
Since 2^2 < 10  continue.
Mark all multiples of 2 as composite by setting their value as 0 in the list. list = [2, 3, 0, 5, 0, 7, 0, 9, 0]
Assign the value of p to the next prime, i.e 3.
Since 3^2 < 10 continue.
Mark all multiples of 3 as composite by setting their value as 0 in the list. list = [2, 3, 0, 5, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]
Assign the value of p to 5.
Since 5^{ 2 }≰10 stop.
We are done!

The list is [2, 3, 0, 5, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]. Since all the numbers which are 0 are composite, all the non-zero numbers are prime. Hence the prime numbers less 11 are 2, 3, 5, 7. _\square
